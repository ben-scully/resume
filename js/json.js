	"story": "Coming from a privilaged 1st world country I wanted find out about Africa and try to help if possible. All I'd seen on TV were hungry kids in the desert with flies hanging over them. I went with 'Habitat for Humanity' who organised two teams of 14 to build chika (mud) homes in Ethiopia. It was incredible experience to meet the local people who made the best life they could even in the face of very difficult circumstances. It was also rewarding getting to know the New Zealanders on the trip who were from all different walks of life and parts of the country. We had to quickly bond as a team to work in the tight timelines & testing conditions.",
